# What is this?
I have been a software-engineer for 3 years and had literally hundreds of links that helped me to learn and understand new topics, as I went from a total beginner knowing nothing about coding after finishing my Bsc in Biology, to getting my first job as a junior developer onto becoming a regular software developer.  
In this time, I bookmarked, and read 100's of links, and articles. I thought these may be of use to others, so I trimmed links that weren't top quality, and collated it to *hopefully* help people.  
I have done my best, to apply high standards of only allowing only *the best* links to make it here, so feel free to add one you think I'm missing, replace a poor link with a better one or make a case for a link to be removed (if it no longer works, or is inaccurate etc.)  

# What's first then?
While this resource is helpful to provide useful guidelines of where to find quality resources, I can't tell you what to do. Does blockchain interest you? Do you want to be a web-developer? Do you want to be front-end or back-end? What even is front and back end? Have you got years of experience reminding yourself what CORS is, or have no idea at all?
